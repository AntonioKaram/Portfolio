      I am passionate about <b>cybersecurity</b> and <b>software engineering</b>.
      My goal is to engineer resource-efficient
      solutions that withstand the test of time. In the tech industry, that means
      building adaptable and scalable solutions. <br />
      <br />
      What drives my passion towards the intersection of those fileds is their
      incorporation of all the components of our tech-driven world: hardware,
      software, and networks. This means that I get to use my
      experience in different fields, from <b>programming</b>, to
      <b> electronics</b>, <b>computer security</b>, <b>web development</b>, and{" "}
      <b>network protocols</b>, to solve problems in a unique and sustainable
      way.
